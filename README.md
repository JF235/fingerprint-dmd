## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains the official implementation of our IJCB 2024 paper, **"Latent Fingerprint Matching via Dense Minutia Descriptor"**. The proposed method improves the accuracy and efficiency of latent fingerprint matching through a robust dense descriptor learned from fingerprint minutiae. The extended journal version named **"Minutiae-Anchored Local Dense Representation for
Fingerprint Matching"** has been made available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15297) and is currently under review.


## 🗞️ News and Updates

    - The extended journal paper has been made available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15297) and is currently under review. New model weights (DMD++) have been released. FDD pipeline will be avaible at [here](https://github.com/Yu-Yy/FLARE).

## ⚙️ Requirements

We recommend running the code on a Linux system with an NVIDIA GPU. Other configurations have not been fully tested.

**Dependencies:**
- `Python == 3.8`
- `torch == 1.10.1`
- `scikit-learn == 1.3.0`
- `scipy == 1.10.1`
- `numpy == 1.24.4`

Install the `torch_linear_assignment` library by compiling it from source as described in the [official repository](https://github.com/ivan-chai/torch-linear-assignment).

Download the './fptools' folder to the root directory of this project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/youngjetduan/fptools.git
````

## 📥 Download Pretrained Weights

Download the pretrained [DMD weights](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/fd5ca22af0eb44afa124/?dl=1) or [DMD++ weights](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/4b3d701bdd7e41ed887f/?dl=1) trained on NIST SD14 (if the weights cannot be downloaded directly, you may use the [DMD backup link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iu8pbI2EjSkwOYsYczosJJDEhd1-JyzU/view?usp=drive_link) or [DMD++ backup link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QFCPZ7aTHCQeIYxdz1t9l92xI9YH7qhe/view?usp=drive_link) instead),  and place them under:

```
./logs/$DMDVersion/   
```


## 📁 Prepare the Dataset

Organize your evaluation dataset in the following format:

```bash
TEST_DATA/
├── NIST27/                     # Replace with your custom dataset name
│   ├── image/                  # Folder for fingerprint images
│   │   ├── query/              # Query images (e.g., latent)
│   │   │   ├── xxxx.bmp
│   │   ├── gallery/            # Gallery images (e.g., reference prints)
│   │       ├── yyyy.bmp
│   │
│   ├── mnt/                    # Folder for minutiae files
│   │   ├── query/              # Minutiae files for query images
│   │   │   ├── xxxx.mnt        # Extracted by VeriFinger or similar tools
│   │   ├── gallery/            # Minutiae files for gallery images
│   │       ├── yyyy.mnt
│   │
│   ├── genuine_pair.txt        # (Optional) File listing genuine query-gallery pairs
```

📌 **Note**: In this implementation, the minutiae coordinates and orientation are defined as:

- **x**: horizontal axis, increases to the right  
- **y**: vertical axis, increases downward (image coordinate system)  
- **θ**: minutia orientation angle, measured from the x-axis with  
  **clockwise rotation taken as the positive direction**

### 📄 Format of `genuine_pair.txt`

Each line in `genuine_pair.txt` defines a genuine matching pair between a query and a gallery image. The file format is as follows:

```
query_filename, gallery_filename
xxxx, yyyy
zzzz, wwww
...
```

An example file about N2N Latent is placed in `datasets/N2NLatent_genuine_pairs.txt`. This file is used in evaluations where explicit genuine pairs are required (e.g., CMC or TAR\@FAR metrics). All remaining combinations are considered impostor pairs by default.

You can preprocess the dataset by running:

```bash
python dump_dataset_mnteval.py --prefix /path/to/dataset
```

## 📈 Evaluation

Run the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate_mnt.py -d $DatasetName -m $DMDVersion -sn
```

The `-sn` flag enables score normalization based on the overlapping area between fingerprints. This option can be flexibly enabled or disabled depending on the evaluation setting. In our original paper, this strategy was applied when evaluating minutiae extracted using VeriFinger, but was not required for minutiae extracted using FDD.
